And maybe how much are of each basin belongs to each ecoregion. Plus show a map.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Level 3 Ecoregions  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Level 3 Ecoregions in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama; the Mississippi Sound Watershed is outlined in black.](EPA_Ecoregions_files/figure-pdf/fig-l3ecoall-1.pdf){#fig-l3ecoall}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Mississippi Sound Watershed contains 4 level-3 ecoregions:  \n\n-  65 Southeastern Plains  \n-  73 Mississippi Alluvial Plain  (in the very southwest corner)  \n-  74 Mississippi Valley Loess Plains  \n-  75 Southern Coastal Plain  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Level 3 Ecoregions in the Mississippi Sound Watershed only.](EPA_Ecoregions_files/figure-pdf/fig-l3ecomssnd-1.pdf){#fig-l3ecomssnd}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Level 4 Ecoregions  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Level 4 Ecoregions in the Mississippi Sound Watershed.](EPA_Ecoregions_files/figure-pdf/fig-l4ecomssnd-1.pdf){#fig-l4ecomssnd}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Data Sources  \n\n**The `.qmd` file** that generated this section was: **EPA_Ecoregions.qmd**.  \n\n#### Ecoregions  \n\nLevel 3 and 4 Ecoregion shapefiles were downloaded from the [EPA's website](https://www.epa.gov/eco-research/level-iii-and-iv-ecoregions-state) on 16 June 2025 for the states of MS, AL, and LA.   \n\nThe original downloaded files along with their metadata files are available in the [EPA EcoRegions](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Q8fZpHI-R40OW7dmQBE0e-VsQ0uSC7R1?usp=drive_link) folder of the [msepCharacterization data files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Oyyrrjl0ygswBak5gbybVLYf5ENGUHD4?usp=sharing) directory.  \n\nThose files were read in, combined, and clipped to the Mississippi Sound Watershed boundaries (using the `outline_full` object from the [`{msepBoundaries}` package](https://github.com/CMEP-MS/msepBoundaries)) using the script `EPAEcoRegion_subsetting.R` ([on github](https://github.com/CMEP-MS/msep_geospatialCharacterization/blob/main/R_preprocessing/EPAEcoRegion_subsetting.R)) in the `R_preprocessing` folder. Three objects resulted: `level3_lamsal`, level 3 ecoregions for the 3 states combined; `level3_mssoundwatershed`, level 3 ecoregions trimmed to only the Mississippi Sound Watershed area; and `level4_mssoundwatershed`, level 4 ecoregions trimmed to only the Mississippi Sound Watershed area. The level 4 ecoregions for the entire three states were not retained because there were so many categories; it really only makes sense to look at these at the smaller level.  \n\nThe resulting objects were saved as layers of a geopackage,   `EPA_EcoRegion.gpkg` in the `data/processed` folder. These files are available in the [processed](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vnTANkxh7lsAcTYFBr4sBuevKoYOGQG4?usp=drive_link) folder of the [msepCharacterization data files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Oyyrrjl0ygswBak5gbybVLYf5ENGUHD4?usp=sharing) directory.
