The national datasets for 2010 and 2020 were downloaded as raster files on 24 July 2025. Only the 2020 dataset has been used here.\n\nThe original downloaded file (zipped; ~3.6 GB) is available in the [Population](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EBiRPhoXG1JNPFQDTasVWiJJI2LV6B-Y?usp=drive_link) folder of the [msepCharacterization data files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Oyyrrjl0ygswBak5gbybVLYf5ENGUHD4?usp=sharing) directory.  \n\nThe dataset was trimmed to Mississippi Sound Watershed boundaries (using the `outline_full` object from the [`{msepBoundaries}` package](https://github.com/CMEP-MS/msepBoundaries)) using the script `Population_2020_subsetting.R` ([on github](https://github.com/CMEP-MS/msep_geospatialCharacterization/blob/main/R_preprocessing/Population_2020_subsetting.R)) in the `R_preprocessing` folder. \n\nThe resulting file, `Population_Dasymetric_2020.tif`, is available in the [processed](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vnTANkxh7lsAcTYFBr4sBuevKoYOGQG4?usp=drive_link) folder of the [msepCharacterization data files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Oyyrrjl0ygswBak5gbybVLYf5ENGUHD4?usp=sharing) directory.  \n",
