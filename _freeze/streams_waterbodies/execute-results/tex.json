More detail on designated uses and water quality standards can be found on [MDEQ's website](https://www.mdeq.ms.gov/water/surface-water/watershed-management/water-quality-standards/).\n\nA 305(b) report (the most recent as of this writing is from 2024; [pdf available here](https://www.mdeq.ms.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024_305b_final.pdf)) is generated every other year, and quantifies how many and which water bodies are / are not meeting the criteria for their designated use.  \n\nHere, we are only summarizing designated uses within the Mississippi Sound Watershed - not assessment of whether criteria are met. See the 305(b) report linked above for more detailed information.  \n\n**The tables below do not include the general 'Fish and Wildlife' designation; that designation applies to most waters of the state.**  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell tbl-cap='Miles of streams with each designated use in the MS Sound Watershed'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Code    |Description                       |   Miles|\n|:-------|:---------------------------------|-------:|\n|REC     |Recreation                        | 1,011.6|\n|PWS     |Public Water Supply               |    26.3|\n|SHF-REC |Shellfish Harvesting & Recreation |    25.3|\n|FW1     |Fish and Wildlife                 |    10.4|\n|EPH     |Ephemeral                         |     1.8|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell tbl-cap='Area of non-linear waterbodies with each designated use in the MS Sound Watershed'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Code    |Description                       | Square Miles|     Acres|\n|:-------|:---------------------------------|------------:|---------:|\n|REC     |Recreation                        |        742.2| 475,019.3|\n|PWS     |Public Water Supply               |         34.8|  22,259.2|\n|SHF-REC |Shellfish Harvesting & Recreation |         22.0|  14,100.5|\n|PWS-REC |Public Water Supply & Recreation  |          0.2|     119.8|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Designated uses of streams and waterbodies of the Mississippi Sound Watershed (navy outline on map), within the state of MS, as defined by MDEQ in the 2015 Water Quality Standards dataset.

What problems are we dealing with in the watershed.   \n\n\n## Data Sources  \n\n**The `.qmd` file** that generated this section was: **streams_waterbodies.qmd**.  \n\n#### Stream Lengths and Waterbody Areas  \n\nStream Lengths and Waterbody Areas were calculated from the [EPA's NHDPlus](https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/nhdplus-national-hydrography-dataset-plus) dataset. Files for the [South Atlantic (03f)](https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/nhdplus-south-atlantic-west-data-vector-processing-unit-03w) and [Lower Mississippi River (03g)](https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/nhdplus-lower-mississippi-data-vector-processing-unit-08) regions were downloaded on 12 June 2025. The original downloaded files are available in the [EPA NHDPlus](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QIMCH0Ae41V2k9ndVEZl-WMy8zcbbF1w?usp=sharing) folder of the [msepCharacterization data files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Oyyrrjl0ygswBak5gbybVLYf5ENGUHD4?usp=sharing) directory.  \n\nThose files were read in, combined, and clipped to only the Mississippi Sound Watershed boundaries (using the `outline_full` object from the [`{msepBoundaries}` package](https://github.com/CMEP-MS/msepBoundaries)) using the script `EPANHD_subsetting.R` ([on github](https://github.com/CMEP-MS/msep_geospatialCharacterization/blob/main/preprocessing_scripts/EPANHD_subsetting.R)) in the `R_preprocessing` folder. The resulting files were saved as geopackages  `EPA_NHDplus_flowline_MSEP.gpkg` and `EPA_NHDplus_waterbody_MSEP.gpkg` in the `data/processed` folder. These files are available in the [processed](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vnTANkxh7lsAcTYFBr4sBuevKoYOGQG4?usp=drive_link) folder of the [msepCharacterization data files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Oyyrrjl0ygswBak5gbybVLYf5ENGUHD4?usp=sharing) directory.  \n\n#### Designated Uses  \n\nShapefiles of designated uses, already limited to the portion of the Mississippi Sound Watershed that lies within the state of MS, were provided by the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) in April 2025. These files provide the designated uses for each waterbody from the 2015 Water Quality Standards dataset. The Mississippi Sound Watershed is made up of MDEQ's Pearl River, Pascagoula River, and Coastal Streams basins. Per MDEQ, \"all waters in those 3 basins not specifically listed in the data provided are classified as Fish and Wildlife.\" See [their website](https://www.mdeq.ms.gov/water/surface-water/watershed-management/water-quality-standards/basins-and-streams/) for more information.  \n\nThe zipped shapefiles are available in **to fill in**.  \n\n#### Impairments  ",
