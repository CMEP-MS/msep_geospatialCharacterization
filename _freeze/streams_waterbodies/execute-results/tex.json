More detail on designated uses and water quality standards can be found on [MDEQ's website](https://www.mdeq.ms.gov/water/surface-water/watershed-management/water-quality-standards/).\n\nA 305(b) report (the most recent as of this writing is from 2024; [pdf available here](https://www.mdeq.ms.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024_305b_final.pdf)) is generated every other year, and quantifies how many and which water bodies are / are not meeting the criteria for their designated use.  \n\nHere, we are only summarizing designated uses within the Mississippi Sound Watershed - not assessment of whether criteria are met. See the 305(b) report linked above for more detailed information.  \n\n**The tables below do not include the general 'Fish and Wildlife' designation; that designation applies to most waters of the state.**  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell tbl-cap='Miles of streams with each designated use in the MS Sound Watershed'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Code    |Description                       |   Miles|\n|:-------|:---------------------------------|-------:|\n|REC     |Recreation                        | 1,011.6|\n|PWS     |Public Water Supply               |    26.3|\n|SHF-REC |Shellfish Harvesting & Recreation |    25.3|\n|FW1     |Fish and Wildlife                 |    10.4|\n|EPH     |Ephemeral                         |     1.8|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell tbl-cap='Area of non-linear waterbodies with each designated use in the MS Sound Watershed'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Code    |Description                       | Square Miles|     Acres|\n|:-------|:---------------------------------|------------:|---------:|\n|REC     |Recreation                        |        742.2| 475,019.3|\n|PWS     |Public Water Supply               |         34.8|  22,259.2|\n|SHF-REC |Shellfish Harvesting & Recreation |         22.0|  14,100.5|\n|PWS-REC |Public Water Supply & Recreation  |          0.2|     119.8|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Designated uses of streams and waterbodies of the Mississippi Sound Watershed (navy outline on map), within the state of MS, as defined by MDEQ in the 2015 Water Quality Standards dataset.
