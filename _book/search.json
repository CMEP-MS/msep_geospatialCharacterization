So the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality uses a slightly different division.\nNEED TO CONFIRM, but I think: HUC12s are the same between MDEQ’s classification and the USGS HUCs. They’re just grouped differently, and the streams that empty into bays or straight into the Sound are the ‘Coastal Streams Basin’. There is also a ‘Coastal Offshore’ grouping, that is comprised of the Sound itself, the islands, and the 3-mile zone beyond the islands.",

More detail on designated uses and water quality standards can be found on MDEQ’s website.\nA 305(b) report (the most recent as of this writing is from 2024; pdf available here) is generated every other year, and quantifies how many and which water bodies are / are not meeting the criteria for their designated use.\nHere, we are only summarizing designated uses within the Mississippi Sound Watershed - not assessment of whether criteria are met.
